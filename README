Project Euler
-------------

These are my implementations of problems found on ProjectEuler.net. They are completed using mostly Perl scripts, but there are a few C++ programs in the beginning.

Note: This is work is the property of Austin Guess. While I sometimes collaborated ideas with other programmers working on these problems, online resources for answers to these questions were not used.
